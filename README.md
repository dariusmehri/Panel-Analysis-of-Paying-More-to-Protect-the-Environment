##Panel Analysis of Paying More to Protect the Environment

This analysis explored the association between how willing respondents would pay higher prices to protect the environment and income. It is hypothesized that as income increases, the willingness to pay higher prices to protect the environment will also increase. Conversely, as political views become more conservative and if one is pressured to pay bills, the willingness to pay higher prices for the environment should decrease. 

The panel is from the General Social Survey and was taken at three intervals, 2006, 2008 and 2010. The dependent variable (willing to pay more for the environment) is only available for panels 2 and 3, and therefore the analysis will be restricted to years 2008 and 2010.  Due to the lack of improvement from the great recession between 2008 and 2010, it is hypothesized that the willingness to pay higher prices for the environment between these two waves should decrease.
